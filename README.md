# Fitness-Edge
The Fitness Center App is a web application built using React that provides information about various exercises, helps users find exercises for specific body parts, and allows them to watch exercise demonstration videos. It's a great resource for fitness enthusiasts looking to discover new exercises and target specific muscle groups.

## What I've Learned
Working on the Fitness Edge App project has been a valuable learning experience. Here are some major takeaways:

React Fundamentals: I gained a solid understanding of React, including components, state management, and routing. React's component-based architecture made it easier to organize and maintain the app's structure.

API Integration: I learned how to make API requests using the fetch API and how to handle asynchronous operations in React. This allowed me to retrieve exercise data and YouTube video information for the app.

State Management: I explored different approaches to state management, including local component state and context-based state using React's Context API. This helped me manage and share data across the app effectively.

UI/UX Design: I improved my skills in designing user interfaces and creating a user-friendly experience. The app's layout, styling, and user interactions were important aspects of the project.

Project Documentation: Writing this README allowed me to document the project, making it easier for others to understand and contribute to the app. Clear documentation is essential for collaboration.

## Features
Exercise Search: Users can search for exercises by exercise name, target muscle group, or equipment used. The app provides a list of matching exercises based on the search criteria.

Body Part Selection: Users can select specific body parts to filter exercises. This feature helps users find exercises that target specific muscle groups.

Exercise Details: Users can click on an exercise to view detailed information, including exercise description, target muscle group, equipment used, and more.

Exercise Videos: The app provides links to exercise demonstration videos from YouTube, allowing users to watch how exercises are performed.

Pagination: When there are multiple search results, the app offers pagination to navigate through the list of exercises.
